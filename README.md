ðŸ§ª Working in Progress
</pre>

## TODO

- [x] **ðŸ˜„ Basic Style.** Port most of the Telegram style to Icalingua++.
- [ ] **ðŸª“ Deep Modification.** Will merge me ssages from the same contact into one to reduce the interface occupancy.
- [ ] **ðŸŽ¨ More Style.** Will add more styles to make Icalingua++ more like Telegram.

## Addon.js

This file is used to help some elements that cannot be directly implemented by changing CSS due to DOM structure to achieve the target style. The functions that have been implemented are:

- [x] Get the width of ChatGroup aside to change ChatGroup Aside to the header menu bar in Telegram style.
- [x] Merge multiple messages from the same contact into one.
- [x] A better way to display the image. (Just for single image message)
- [ ] Remove the icon to reply to the message and change it to the style that you can reply to the message by clicking.
- [ ] Mouse slide reply message
- [ ] Mouse slide message list
