## Motivation

I like the style of Telegram Desktop very much, but in some areas it couldn't be accessed. Instead, Icalingua++ is a great alternative to Telegram Desktop. So I decided to make a Telegram-like theme for Icalingua++.

## Attentions

- _**You should **switch on** the "é»˜è®¤ä½¿ç”¨æœ¬åœ°å›¾ç‰‡æŸ¥çœ‹å™¨" option in Icalingua++**._ Because of the limitation of Icalingua++, I changed the DOM structure of the message list, so I can't implement the function of clicking the image to enlarge it. So you should use the local image viewer to achieve this function. 
- It **forces** a lot of changes to the **DOM structure**, which can cause problems with some functions
- Since we want to enhance the functionality, we may need to start a **child process**. If you **don't trust me**, you don't have to use this theme.

## Features

- **ðŸ˜„ Basic Style.** Port most of the Telegram style to Icalingua++.
- **ðŸª“ Deep Modification.** Merge me ssages from the same contact into one to reduce the interface occupancy.
  - **ðŸ“· Better Image Display.** Display the image in a better way.
  - **ðŸ”— Auto parse URL.** Auto parse URL to display the title and description of the website.
  - **ðŸ§¸ New Icons.** Replace the icons with Telegram-like style icons.
  - **ðŸ“œ Good-looking Modal.** Change the style of the modal to make it more beautiful.
- **ðŸŽ¨ More Style.** Will add more styles to make Icalingua++ more like Telegram.
